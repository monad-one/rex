# REX

A recommendation system in the GCP.

## Why REX?

Basically I like the way it sounded as a contraction of recommendation systems, ie:

Recommendation System => RecSys => REX

## Components

- `src/algs`: recommendation algorithms
- `src/db`: database creation scripts
- `src/gcf`: cloud functions
- `src/rex`: presentation layer
